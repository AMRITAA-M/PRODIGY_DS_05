Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of traffic accident data to uncover patterns and insights related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The objective was to identify critical factors contributing to accidents and visualize accident hotspots using data visualization techniques. Through this task, I applied data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geospatial visualization to highlight trends and correlations in the dataset. The findings from this analysis can be valuable in supporting decision-making for road safety improvements and accident prevention strategies. This task significantly enhanced my analytical thinking and hands-on experience with tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
